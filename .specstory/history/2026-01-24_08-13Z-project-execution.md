<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user wants me to run this project. Looking at the project structure, it appears to be a Vite + React project (based on vite.config.js, package.json, and the .jsx files). Let me first check if there are any terminals already running, and then start the development server.</details></think>

This is a Vite + React project. No terminals are currently running. I'll start the development server using `npm run dev`. Since this requires network access for the dev server, I'll need to request network permissions.</details></think>

I'll start the Vite development server for you.

The project is now running! 🚀

The Vite development server is up and ready at **http://localhost:5173/**

You can open this URL in your browser to view the application.

The user wants me to open the URL in the Cursor browser. I can use a terminal command to open it. On macOS, I can use the `open` command to open a URL in the default browser, but the user specifically asked for the "Cursor browser". 

In Cursor, there's a Simple Browser feature that can be opened. I can try using the `cursor` CLI or use a special command. Let me try opening it with a command that would work in Cursor's context.

Actually, I should just provide the user with the link and they can click on it, or I can try to use a command to open the Simple Browser in Cursor. Let me check if there's a way to do this via terminal.

In Cursor/VS Code, you can use the command palette or use `code --open-url` but for the Simple Browser specifically, there isn't a direct CLI command. The user can:
1. Use Cmd+Shift+P and type "Simple Browser: Show" and enter the URL
2. Or I can just tell them to click on the link

Let me just inform them how to do it since there's no direct command to open Cursor's built-in Simple Browser from the terminal.</details></think>

To open the Simple Browser in Cursor:

1. Press **Cmd+Shift+P** (or Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows/Linux)
2. Type **"Simple Browser: Show"** and select it
3. Enter the URL: `http://localhost:5173/`

Alternatively, you can simply **Cmd+click** (or Ctrl+click) on this link: http://localhost:5173/

This will open the app directly in Cursor's built-in browser panel.
